# A certain feature/module

Consider a `feature/module` to be one of the part of the application, these part can be based on main routes like dashboard, settings etc.
Each feature will have the same folder structure, features eg - dashboard, login, settings, admin panel etc.

**Rules:**

1. Keep feature-specific components, pages, and routes here.
2. Cannot import anything from other feature, only core and shared.
